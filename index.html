                                my favorite furball in the whole wide 
                                world. She is a little over a year old 
                                and she is the sweetest cat you will 
                                ever meet. She enjoys being picked up
                                and being carried like a baby, she's an
                                adventourus cat that enjoys the outdoors
                                as she is able to sneak out of the house
                                occasionally but never goes too far,
                                she knows when to sit on your lap to pin
                                you to a chair, especially when you need 
                                to do something, she's playful to both 
                                human and other pets within the house, and 
                                she meows until she finally gets what she 
                                wants. She's never a handful and having her
                                around has been the cause for so much 
                                happiness for everyone around her, including
                                me. I hope anyone reading this gets to enjoy 
                                some of the silly moments that were captured 
                                on camera of he silliness, a sneak peak into
                                the daily life of Wenli, my adorable cat.
